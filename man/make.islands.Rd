\title{Islands and Gaps Calculation}
\usage{
make.islands(srcData, mapFields, timeFields, timeout, boundaryName = "episode", archipelago = TRUE, show.all = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{srcData}{(object): The source dataset, including all non-sessioning fields desired}

\item{mapFields}{(string): A comma-separated string literal containing field names that will partition `data`}

\item{timeFields}{(string): A comma-separated string literal containing field names to use as "start" and "stop" temporal indices.  If only one value is given, that value will be repeated as the "stop" index}

\item{timeout}{(numeric): The largest allowable 'gap' in a series of time values before a new 'island' begins: can be a quoted expression that conditionally determines the value.}

\item{boundaryName}{(string): The name root of the boundary column names (e.g., "episode" -> "episode_start_idx", "episode_end_idx")}

\item{archipelago}{(logical | TRUE): Should the output include the islands and gaps generated?}

\item{show.all}{(logical | FALSE): Should the output include all of the columns of the output?}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns <mapFields>, ..., timeOut, ISLAND, island_idx, where '...' is empty if `show.all` is FALSE
}
\description{
\code{make.islands} is conceptually based on the \href{https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/the-sql-of-gaps-and-islands-in-sequences/}{'islands & gaps'} concept.
